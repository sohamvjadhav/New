# Glossary of Key Terms

*   **ACK (Acknowledgment)**: A signal passed between communicating processes to signify acknowledgment of receipt of response.
*   **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: A protocol used to map an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address).
*   **Bandwidth**: The maximum amount of data that can travel through a channel.
*   **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: A method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing that replaces the previous classful IP addressing system.
*   **DNS (Domain Name System)**: The system that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
*   **Encryption**: The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Firewall**: A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
*   **Gateway**: A node (router) in a computer network, a key stopping point for data on its way to or from other networks.
*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
*   **IP (Internet Protocol)**: The principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries.
*   **MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)**: A unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: A method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit.
*   **Packet**: A formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.
*   **Router**: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
*   **Subnet Mask**: A 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address.
*   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
*   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.
*   **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A service that creates a safe, encrypted online connection.
